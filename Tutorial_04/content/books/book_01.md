Operating System Concepts, now in its ninth edition, continues to provide a solid theoretical
foundation for understanding operating systems. The ninth edition has been thoroughly updated to
include contemporary examples of how operating systems function. The text includes content to
bridge the gap between concepts and actual implementations. End-of-chapter problems, exercises,
review questions, and programming exercises help to further reinforce important concepts. A new
Virtual Machine provides interactive exercises to help engage students with the material.
